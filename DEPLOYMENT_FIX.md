# 🚀 Deployment Fix: Updated pnpm Lock File

## ❌ **Deployment Error Fixed:**

```
ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE  Cannot install with "frozen-lockfile" because pnpm-lock.yaml is not up to date with <ROOT>/package.json

Failure reason:
specifiers in the lockfile don't match specifiers in package.json:
* 7 dependencies were added: @testing-library/jest-dom@^6.6.3, @testing-library/react@^16.1.0, @testing-library/user-event@^14.5.2, @types/jest@^29.5.14, jest@^29.7.0, jest-environment-jsdom@^29.7.0, ts-jest@^29.2.5
```

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**

1. **Updated pnpm-lock.yaml** by running `pnpm install` to synchronize with package.json
2. **Verified build process** works correctly with all new dependencies
3. **Confirmed all Jest testing dependencies** are properly installed

## 📦 **New Dependencies Added for Testing:**

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.6.3",
    "@testing-library/react": "^16.1.0", 
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.5.2",
    "@types/jest": "^29.5.14",
    "jest": "^29.7.0",
    "jest-environment-jsdom": "^29.7.0",
    "ts-jest": "^29.2.5"
  }
}
```

## 🔧 **Files Modified:**

- ✅ `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Updated to include all new dependencies
- ✅ `package.json` - Already contained the new dependencies 
- ✅ Build verification completed successfully

## 🚀 **Deployment Status:**

✅ **Lock file synchronized**  
✅ **Build process verified**  
✅ **All dependencies resolved**  
✅ **Ready for deployment**

## 📋 **Next Steps for Deployment:**

1. **Commit the updated pnpm-lock.yaml file:**
   ```bash
   git add pnpm-lock.yaml
   git commit -m "fix: update pnpm lock file for new testing dependencies"
   ```

2. **Push to your deployment branch:**
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

3. **Deploy** - The deployment should now succeed without the frozen lockfile error

## 🧪 **Testing Features Added:**

The new dependencies enable comprehensive testing of:
- ✅ API endpoints and data fetching optimization
- ✅ React hooks and component behavior  
- ✅ Admin functionality and CRUD operations
- ✅ Error handling and fallback scenarios
- ✅ Performance improvements and caching

## 🎯 **Performance Improvements Included:**

- ⚡ **Reduced API calls** from 3 to 1 for landing page data
- ⚡ **Parallel database queries** for optimal performance
- ⚡ **HTTP caching** with 5-minute cache headers
- ⚡ **Single loading state** instead of multiple spinners
- ⚡ **Graceful error handling** with static fallback data

Your deployment should now work successfully! 🎉
